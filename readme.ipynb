    "On average, there are 6 million car accidents in the U.S. every year. That's roughly 16,438 car accidents per day. Of those 6 million car accidents, over 3 million people experience a non-fatal injury and over 37,000 Americans experience death. Over 100 people die per day due to car accidents in any given year. A 2016 study by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) found that human error accounts for 96% of all auto accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "A self driving car, also known as an autonomous vehicle, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing it's environment and moving safely with no human input. An autonomous vehicle needs sensory input devices like cameras, radars,  and lidars to allow the car to perceive the world around it, creating a digital map. Object detection is a two-part process, image classification and then image localization. Our focus will be image classification, which is determining what the objects in a image are. Is it a car, traffic light, a person or all of the above?\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this question, we built a convolutional neural network using the Berkely DeepDrive dataset to create a multi-label model which contains 70,000 training images and 10,000 validation images. \n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-label CNN model was responsible in predicting up to 12 labels in any given image. The dataset possesses geographic, environmental and weather diversity which is useful for training models that are less likely to be surprised by new conditions. Image classification labels consist of ['lane', 'drivable area', 'truck', 'motor', 'person', 'rider', 'bike', 'train', 'car', 'traffic light', 'bus', 'traffic sign']. Instead of using accuracy as our primary indicator on how well a model performs, we used Hamming Loss. The Hamming Loss function takes the number of incorrect labels predicted and divides it by the total number of labels. The lower the number (closer to 0), the better the model performed. The final cnn model produced a hamming score of 11%, which can be interpretated as 89% percent correctly predicted labels."

    "\n",
    "1. Since this model is not predicting all objects correctly, car companies can use this model as a driver assistant to help alert the driver of what is seen on the road. Essentially a second pair of eyes which would be great when driving in either the dark, day or rush hour. This will help mitigate the occurrence of car accidents. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. This model can be used as a starting point for companies that are creating a self driving electric car. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. If you are building your own multi-label image classification model; I recommend the following; \n",
    "  * Use a convolutional neural network.\n",
    "  * A dataset that possesses geographic, environmental, and weather diversity, which is useful for training models that are less likely to be surprised by new conditions."

    "To improve our project, the following steps have been outlined\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data augmentation for labels that occured the least. This will improve the model and help classify objects that are rarely seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increase image size. The larger the image (while keeping its sharpness) will improve the model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adding object localization. In this project, we completed object detection (image classification) which is to classify and detect all objects in a image.  The next step is object localization which is locating where that object is and drawing a bounding box. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explore other frameworks such as MEKA, LSTM and YOLO that can be used for multi-label classification problems "
